# 🧠 Problem Solving in JavaScript

This repository contains my solutions to coding challenges from different problem solving platforms.  
I use JavaScript and organize solutions by platform and topic.

> **Note:**  
> Some problems may have more than one solution.  
> Not all solutions are originally mine — in some cases, I research and add optimized or alternative solutions from other sources for the purpose of learning, comparison, and improving my problem-solving skills.  
> Each solution included here helps me understand different approaches and patterns.

> **Note about Codewars:**  
> I initially started solving problems on Codewars because I had heard it was an easy entry point. However, I found the problems too easy to help me grow significantly, so I switched focus to LeetCode to challenge myself with more algorithmic problems and improve my problem-solving skills.
